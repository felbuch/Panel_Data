    "One way to eliminate unobserved heterogeneities that are fixed in time is to see how changes in beer tax affect changes in fatalities. That's the rationale behind __First Difference (FD) regression__.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we tackle a full-scale FD model, let's consider a simpler case where we have only two time periods. Let's consider only the first year (1982) and the last year (1988) and see how changes in beer rate from 1982 to 1988 relate to changes in fatalities over the same period. Colloquially, this is what we would call a before-and-after analysis. More technically, this approach is also called a __difference-in-difference (diff-in-diff)  model__, since we'll regress a _difference_ in fatalities on  on a _difference_ in beer tax. \n",

    "Considering only the years of 1982 and 1988, run a differences-in-differences regression to estimate the effect of beer tax on fatalities. Interpret your results. Do they make sense? Let me be more specific:\n",

    "### (b) First differences regression\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious problem of diff-in-diff is that it considers only two years. First Differences regression has no such problem: it can take all years in our dataset into account.  \n",
